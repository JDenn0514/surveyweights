# Changelog

## surveywts 0.3.0

### New features

#### Calibration

- [`calibrate_rake()`](https://jdenn0514.github.io/surveywts/reference/calibrate_rake.md)
  replaces `rake()`. It takes `targets` in place of `margins` and
  `algorithm` in place of `method`. `algorithm = "classic_ipf"` is
  iterative proportional fitting, the engine `rake()` used.
  `algorithm = "nr"` is Newton-Raphson raking (Deville, Sarndal &
  Sautory 1993), which uses the exponential calibration function.

- [`calibrate_linear()`](https://jdenn0514.github.io/surveywts/reference/calibrate_linear.md)
  calibrates to linear (GREG) and truncated-linear targets, following
  Deville & Sarndal (1992). Bounds are optional, and `bounds_scale`
  reads them as multiplicative or absolute. The calibrated weights match
  [`survey::calibrate()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/survey/man/calibrate.html)
  to within 1e-8.

- [`calibrate_logit()`](https://jdenn0514.github.io/surveywts/reference/calibrate_logit.md)
  calibrates with the logit calibration function, following Deville,
  Sarndal & Sautory (1993). `bounds` is required and holds each g-weight
  inside the open interval it names, so every calibrated weight is
  strictly positive. The weights match
  `survey::calibrate(calfun = "logit")` to within 1e-8.

- [`calibrate_rake()`](https://jdenn0514.github.io/surveywts/reference/calibrate_rake.md),
  [`calibrate_linear()`](https://jdenn0514.github.io/surveywts/reference/calibrate_linear.md),
  and
  [`calibrate_logit()`](https://jdenn0514.github.io/surveywts/reference/calibrate_logit.md)
  take `unit_scale`, a vector of per-unit scaling factors (the q-weights
  of Deville & Sarndal 1992).

- The four calibration functions accept `survey_replicate` input and
  calibrate every replicate weight column.
  `@calibration$replicate_converged` names the columns that did not
  converge.

- A survey object returned by
  [`calibrate_rake()`](https://jdenn0514.github.io/surveywts/reference/calibrate_rake.md),
  [`calibrate_linear()`](https://jdenn0514.github.io/surveywts/reference/calibrate_linear.md),
  [`calibrate_logit()`](https://jdenn0514.github.io/surveywts/reference/calibrate_logit.md),
  or
  [`poststratify()`](https://jdenn0514.github.io/surveywts/reference/poststratify.md)
  carries a `@calibration` slot. The slot holds the calibration
  provenance: the g-weights, the discrepancy from the targets, the
  cross-product inverse, and the converged Lagrange vector.

- The four calibration functions take `reference_design`. A
  `survey_taylor` supplied here is stored in the weighting history, so a
  later quasi-randomization bootstrap can re-estimate the targets in
  each draw.

#### Sample-based calibration

- [`calibrate_to_survey()`](https://jdenn0514.github.io/surveywts/reference/calibrate_to_survey.md)
  calibrates a design to a control survey. Each replicate is calibrated
  to the matching control replicate, so the variance of the control
  totals reaches the variance estimate. `targets` adds fixed census
  margins alongside the control-survey margins.

- [`calibrate_to_estimate()`](https://jdenn0514.github.io/surveywts/reference/calibrate_to_estimate.md)
  calibrates to control totals given as a named list of counts and a
  variance-covariance matrix. Each replicate is calibrated to a
  perturbed draw from that distribution.

- Both functions accept a `survey_nonprob` that carries replicate
  weights, and both return the class of the design they were given.

#### Non-probability samples

- [`ipw()`](https://jdenn0514.github.io/surveywts/reference/ipw.md)
  builds inverse probability weights for a non-probability sample from a
  probability reference design, following Chen, Li & Wu (2020) and
  Elliott & Valliant (2017). The links `logit`, `probit`, and `cloglog`
  are supported. The default `estimating_eq = "gee"` solves the
  calibration estimating equation with
  [`nleqslv::nleqslv()`](https://bertcarnell.github.io/nleqslv/reference/nleqslv.html)
  and gives exact covariate balance; `estimating_eq = "mle"` solves the
  pseudo-likelihood score equation. `reference` accepts a
  `survey_taylor` or a `survey_replicate`.

- `adjust_nonresponse(method = "propensity")` fits a response propensity
  model and adjusts each respondent weight by its own inverse score.
  This method requires `formula`.

- `adjust_nonresponse(method = "propensity-cell")` sorts the propensity
  scores into quantile cells, `control$n_cells` of them, and
  redistributes the nonrespondent weight inside each cell.

- [`redistribute_weights()`](https://jdenn0514.github.io/surveywts/reference/redistribute_weights.md)
  takes the weight of the rows that `reduce_if` names and transfers it
  to the rows that `increase_if` names, in proportion to the weight
  those rows already hold. `by` restricts the transfer to within groups.

#### Replicate weights for non-probability samples

- `create_bootstrap_weights(type = "quasi-randomization")` produces
  quasi-randomization bootstrap weights for a `survey_nonprob`. Each
  draw resamples the sample and the reference with replacement, then
  re-estimates the weights. Three histories are supported: IPW alone,
  calibration alone, and both.

- `create_jackknife_weights(type = "grouped")` produces delete-a-group
  jackknife weights for a `survey_nonprob` (Valliant, Brick & Dever
  2008). It refits the propensity model in every replicate and replays a
  stored calibration.

#### Weight utilities

- [`trim_weights()`](https://jdenn0514.github.io/surveywts/reference/trim_weights.md)
  clips extreme weights and redistributes the trimmed weight to the
  units it kept, following Potter & Zheng (2015). The cutpoints come
  from the interquartile range, from absolute bounds, or from
  percentiles. `strict = TRUE` repeats the trim until every weight is
  inside the bounds.

- [`rescale_weights()`](https://jdenn0514.github.io/surveywts/reference/rescale_weights.md)
  scales the weights so they sum to the sample size, either across the
  sample or inside groups that `by` names.

- Both functions also operate on each replicate weight column of a
  `survey_replicate`, and of a `survey_nonprob` that carries replicate
  weights.

#### Diagnostics

- [`effective_sample_size()`](https://jdenn0514.github.io/surveywts/reference/effective_sample_size.md),
  [`weight_variability()`](https://jdenn0514.github.io/surveywts/reference/weight_variability.md),
  and
  [`summarize_weights()`](https://jdenn0514.github.io/surveywts/reference/summarize_weights.md)
  accept `survey_replicate` input. They read the main weight column;
  they do not compute the replicate variance of a diagnostic.

### Breaking changes

#### `rake()` is removed

Call
[`calibrate_rake()`](https://jdenn0514.github.io/surveywts/reference/calibrate_rake.md)
instead. `targets` replaces `margins`, and `algorithm` replaces
`method`. The algorithm named `"anesrake"` is now `"classic_ipf"`; the
algorithm itself is unchanged. Algorithm `"survey"` is removed. The
history `operation` field reads `"calibrate_rake"`, not `"raking"`.

#### `calibrate()` is a dispatcher

[`calibrate()`](https://jdenn0514.github.io/surveywts/reference/calibrate.md)
now routes to
[`calibrate_rake()`](https://jdenn0514.github.io/surveywts/reference/calibrate_rake.md),
[`calibrate_linear()`](https://jdenn0514.github.io/surveywts/reference/calibrate_linear.md),
or
[`calibrate_logit()`](https://jdenn0514.github.io/surveywts/reference/calibrate_logit.md).
The `method` argument changes from `c("linear", "logit")` with default
`"linear"` to `c("rake", "linear", "logit")` with default `"rake"`. One
`targets` argument replaces `variables` and `population`. Code that
relied on the old default should call
[`calibrate_linear()`](https://jdenn0514.github.io/surveywts/reference/calibrate_linear.md).

#### `poststratify()` takes `targets`

`poststratify(data, strata, population, ...)` becomes
`poststratify(data, targets, ...)`. `targets` is one data frame. Every
column except `target` names a stratifying variable.

#### `create_jackknife_weights()` type values are renamed

| Old | New |
|----|----|
| `type = "delete-1"` | `type = "jkn"` (stratified) or `type = "jk1"` (unstratified) |
| `type = "random-groups"` | `type = "grouped"` |

`type = "delete-1"` read the design and chose JKn or JK1 for the caller.
The caller now names the one they want. The delete-a-group jackknife for
non-probability samples arrives on the same argument, as
`type = "grouped"` with a `survey_nonprob` input.

#### `create_bootstrap_weights()` reads `mse` as a string

`mse` moves from `TRUE` or `FALSE` to `"mse"` (the default),
`"chrostowski"`, or `"uncentered"`. Replace `mse = FALSE` with
`mse = "uncentered"`.

The `replicates` default moves from `500L` to `NULL`. `NULL` resolves to
`500L` for the probability-sample types and to `200L` for
`type = "quasi-randomization"`.

#### All weighting functions now require survey objects

All calibration, nonresponse, utility, and diagnostic functions
([`calibrate()`](https://jdenn0514.github.io/surveywts/reference/calibrate.md),
[`calibrate_rake()`](https://jdenn0514.github.io/surveywts/reference/calibrate_rake.md),
[`calibrate_linear()`](https://jdenn0514.github.io/surveywts/reference/calibrate_linear.md),
[`calibrate_logit()`](https://jdenn0514.github.io/surveywts/reference/calibrate_logit.md),
[`poststratify()`](https://jdenn0514.github.io/surveywts/reference/poststratify.md),
[`adjust_nonresponse()`](https://jdenn0514.github.io/surveywts/reference/adjust_nonresponse.md),
[`redistribute_weights()`](https://jdenn0514.github.io/surveywts/reference/redistribute_weights.md),
[`trim_weights()`](https://jdenn0514.github.io/surveywts/reference/trim_weights.md),
[`rescale_weights()`](https://jdenn0514.github.io/surveywts/reference/rescale_weights.md),
[`effective_sample_size()`](https://jdenn0514.github.io/surveywts/reference/effective_sample_size.md),
[`weight_variability()`](https://jdenn0514.github.io/surveywts/reference/weight_variability.md),
[`summarize_weights()`](https://jdenn0514.github.io/surveywts/reference/summarize_weights.md))
now require a `survey_taylor`, `survey_nonprob`, or `survey_replicate`
object as the `data` (or `x`) argument. Plain `data.frame` and
`weighted_df` inputs now throw `surveywts_error_not_survey_base`.

The `weighted_df` S3 class and all associated infrastructure have been
removed: `.make_weighted_df()`, `dplyr_reconstruct.weighted_df()`,
`print.weighted_df()`, and the `weight_col` / `weighting_history`
attributes are no longer part of the package.

#### `wt_name` default changed from `"wts"` to `NULL`

All weighting functions that accept a `wt_name` argument now default to
`wt_name = NULL`. When `NULL`, calibrated / adjusted weights overwrite
the existing weight column in-place. When a character scalar, a new
column is created and `@variables$weights` is updated to point to it.

#### `calibrate_to_survey()` — native Opsomer algorithm replaces svrep delegation

[`calibrate_to_survey()`](https://jdenn0514.github.io/surveywts/reference/calibrate_to_survey.md)
now implements the Opsomer & Erciulescu (2022) replication variance
adjustment natively. The svrep delegation (via
[`svrep::calibrate_to_sample()`](https://bschneidr.github.io/svrep/reference/calibrate_to_sample.html))
has been removed from the main calibration path. Existing calls with
`targets = NULL` will continue to produce calibrated designs, but the
replicate weight adjustment now uses the Opsomer algorithm directly
rather than delegating to svrep. Numerical results may differ slightly
from prior versions.

The default calibration method is now `method = "rake"`. The prior
svrep-based path used linear GREG by default; callers who need that
behavior should supply `method = "linear"` explicitly.

#### `calibrate_to_survey()` history entry schema change

The weighting history entry produced by
[`calibrate_to_survey()`](https://jdenn0514.github.io/surveywts/reference/calibrate_to_survey.md)
now promotes `K`, `a_constants`, `targets`, `type`, and
`fixed_variables` as top-level fields on the history entry (in addition
to being stored under `parameters`). Code that accessed these values via
`entry$parameters$K` should now use `entry$K` instead. The `parameters`
sub-list retains all fields for backward compatibility.

### Bug fixes

- [`create_sdr_weights()`](https://jdenn0514.github.io/surveywts/reference/create_sdr_weights.md)
  did not forward `use_normal_hadamard` to
  [`svrep::as_sdr_design()`](https://bschneidr.github.io/svrep/reference/as_sdr_design.html)
  ([\#119](https://github.com/JDenn0514/surveywts/issues/119)), so the
  back end always ran at the svrep default `FALSE`. On that path the
  Hadamard order doubles from 4 — 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256 and on up —
  so a request for 50 returned 64.

  `use_normal_hadamard` is now an argument, with the same default
  `FALSE`. No existing call changes. At `TRUE` the order comes from a
  finer grid, so a request for 50 returns 56 and a request for 20
  returns 20. The finer grid costs inactive replicates — columns whose
  replicate factors all equal 1. The count rises as the PSU count falls
  relative to the order. An inactive replicate is valid for variance
  estimation.

  The two settings give different variance estimates once the PSU count
  exceeds the smaller order, and the gap grows with the PSU count. Both
  are valid. Keep the default to reproduce existing results. The
  Algorithm section of
  [`?create_sdr_weights`](https://jdenn0514.github.io/surveywts/reference/create_sdr_weights.md)
  gives the check to run and the measured sizes.

  Two further differences at the same order. For a total both settings
  give the same variance at `mse = TRUE`; for a mean they can differ. At
  `mse = FALSE` they differ for a total as well.

  This reverses decision Q8 of the replicate phase, which hid the
  argument.

- The SDR variance formula in the
  [`create_sdr_weights()`](https://jdenn0514.github.io/surveywts/reference/create_sdr_weights.md)
  help page printed the scale factor as `1 / (2R)`. The scale factor is
  `4 / R`, which is what the function has always computed. The published
  formula understated the variance by a factor of 8, so a reader who
  reimplemented it, or who checked surveywts against it, got a standard
  error too small by a factor of about 2.83. No computed result changes;
  only the documented formula does.

- Both propensity methods of
  [`adjust_nonresponse()`](https://jdenn0514.github.io/surveywts/reference/adjust_nonresponse.md)
  warned “non-integer \#successes in a binomial glm!” on every call
  ([\#110](https://github.com/JDenn0514/surveywts/issues/110)). The fits
  passed `family = binomial` to
  [`stats::glm()`](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/glm.html) with the survey
  weights as case weights. Survey weights are not integer counts, so
  base R warned, and the warning appeared twice on the help page once
  the examples covered all three methods.

  Both fits now use `family = quasibinomial`, the standard choice for a
  weighted logistic regression. The two families share the IRLS step, so
  the coefficients, the fitted propensity scores, and the adjusted
  weights are unchanged: on `gss_2024` with a simulated response
  indicator, the `"propensity"` weights match the old fit to the last
  bit. The convergence handler still fires, because “algorithm did not
  converge” comes from [`glm.fit()`](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/glm.html)
  and does not depend on the family.

- The quasi-randomization bootstrap wrote resample-order weights into
  original-order rows
  ([\#102](https://github.com/JDenn0514/surveywts/issues/102)).
  `.quasi_randomization_bootstrap()` drew a resample, refit the
  weighting model on it, and stored the returned vector straight into a
  `repwt_*` column. Both vectors have the same length, so nothing
  errored: row *i* held the weight of whatever unit landed at position
  *i* of the resample. The column was a permutation of roughly the right
  values, so it summed to the base weight’s scale while its correlation
  with the base weight was about 0. Every replicate estimate collapsed
  toward the unweighted mean, in the same direction across all columns,
  which `mse = TRUE` then turned into the variance. On `ns_wave1`
  weighted to `npors_2025_clean`, the four replicate estimates of mean
  `age` centred on 45.71 against the weighted 47.43; they now centre on
  47.37.

  Each replicate column is now mapped back to original-unit order. A
  unit the draw picked `m` times carries the sum of the weights of its
  `m` copies, so an estimator applied to the column returns the value
  that draw produced. A unit the draw did not pick carries 0, so about
  37% of each column is now zero where none was before. This affects
  `create_bootstrap_weights(type = "quasi-randomization")` and
  `create_replicate_weights(method = "bootstrap", type = "quasi-randomization")`.
  The five probability types were unaffected; their separate defect is
  [\#101](https://github.com/JDenn0514/surveywts/issues/101) above.

- The probability replicate creators stored replication factors instead
  of finished replicate weights
  ([\#101](https://github.com/JDenn0514/surveywts/issues/101)). `survey`
  and `svrep` return the replicate matrix with
  `combined.weights = FALSE`, meaning each value is a factor to apply to
  the base weight. `.convert_and_call()` copied that matrix straight
  into `@variables$repweights`, which surveycore reads as finished
  weights, so the base weight was never folded in. Every variance
  estimate from
  [`create_bootstrap_weights()`](https://jdenn0514.github.io/surveywts/reference/create_bootstrap_weights.md),
  [`create_jackknife_weights()`](https://jdenn0514.github.io/surveywts/reference/create_jackknife_weights.md)
  (types `"jkn"`, `"jk1"`, `"grouped"`),
  [`create_brr_weights()`](https://jdenn0514.github.io/surveywts/reference/create_brr_weights.md),
  [`create_gen_boot_weights()`](https://jdenn0514.github.io/surveywts/reference/create_gen_boot_weights.md),
  [`create_gen_rep_weights()`](https://jdenn0514.github.io/surveywts/reference/create_gen_rep_weights.md),
  and
  [`create_sdr_weights()`](https://jdenn0514.github.io/surveywts/reference/create_sdr_weights.md)
  was wrong. On `gss_2024` with `weights = wtssps`, the mean of `age`
  had a confidence interval of 42.9-53.0 against 47.0-48.9 from
  [`survey::svymean()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/survey/man/surveysummary.html)
  on the Taylor design; it now returns 47.05-48.82. The base weight is
  folded in at extraction time, so each replicate column is a finished
  weight on the same scale as the base weight column.

  The DAGJK path (`create_jackknife_weights(type = "grouped")` on a
  `survey_nonprob`) was already correct and is unchanged. The
  quasi-randomization bootstrap has a separate defect with a different
  cause, fixed under
  [\#102](https://github.com/JDenn0514/surveywts/issues/102) above.

- The grouped jackknife and the quasi-randomization bootstrap replay a
  stored calibration once per replicate
  ([\#111](https://github.com/JDenn0514/surveywts/issues/111)). Each
  replay that already met its margins printed its own convergence line,
  so a call with `replicates = 25` could print up to 25 identical lines.

  The message comes from the calibration call, not from the replicate
  loop, so the fix sits at the two replay sites instead of at the
  message’s source. Each replicate body now runs under a handler that
  catches and counts `surveywts_message_already_calibrated`. One line
  after the loop reports the count, under a new class,
  `surveywts_message_replay_already_calibrated`. On `ns_wave1` weighted
  to `npors_2025_clean` with 25 replicates, that line reads “Raking
  converged in 1 sweep in 22 of 25 replicates: those replicates already
  met their margins.” A direct call to
  [`calibrate_rake()`](https://jdenn0514.github.io/surveywts/reference/calibrate_rake.md)
  still prints the per-replicate message on every call; only the two
  replay sites catch it.

  **Compatibility note:** code that wrapped a replay call in
  [`withCallingHandlers()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/conditions.html) or
  [`tryCatch()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/conditions.html), matching on
  `surveywts_message_already_calibrated`, no longer fires. The muffling
  handler sits deeper in the call stack and runs first. This is
  intended.

- [`create_gen_boot_weights()`](https://jdenn0514.github.io/surveywts/reference/create_gen_boot_weights.md),
  [`create_gen_rep_weights()`](https://jdenn0514.github.io/surveywts/reference/create_gen_rep_weights.md),
  and
  [`create_sdr_weights()`](https://jdenn0514.github.io/surveywts/reference/create_sdr_weights.md)
  printed an unclassed `svrep` message on every successful call
  ([\#114](https://github.com/JDenn0514/surveywts/issues/114)). The
  messages were plain [`message()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/message.html)
  calls, so the only way to quiet one was a blanket
  [`suppressMessages()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/message.html), which
  also swallowed every surveywts message.

  All three now carry a class: `surveywts_message_row_order_assumed`,
  `surveywts_message_replicates_rounded_up`, and
  `surveywts_message_replicates_subsampled`. A message from the back end
  that surveywts does not recognise keeps its text and arrives as
  `surveywts_message_backend_note`.

  Two of the texts changed. The
  [`create_sdr_weights()`](https://jdenn0514.github.io/surveywts/reference/create_sdr_weights.md)
  message now names `replicates` and the real column count, and it fires
  only when the two differ.
  [`create_gen_rep_weights()`](https://jdenn0514.github.io/surveywts/reference/create_gen_rep_weights.md)
  now points at `seed` when it keeps a random sample of the replicates
  and no seed was given.

- The quasi-randomization bootstrap left `@variables$scale`,
  `@variables$rscales`, `@variables$type`, and `@variables$mse` empty on
  the `survey_nonprob` it returned
  ([\#78](https://github.com/JDenn0514/surveywts/issues/78)).
  [`calibrate_to_survey()`](https://jdenn0514.github.io/surveywts/reference/calibrate_to_survey.md)
  reads `scale`, so it threw `surveywts_error_scale_not_found` when a
  bootstrapped design arrived as `primary_design` or `control_design`.
  All four fields are now set: `scale` is `1 / draws_used`, `rscales`
  holds one 1 per draw, `type` is `"bootstrap"`, and `mse` follows the
  `mse` argument.

- `cap = NULL` applied a cap of 5 in the raking engine, the
  [`anesrake::anesrake()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/anesrake/man/anesrake.html)
  default. `cap = NULL` now means no cap.

### Datasets

#### New datasets

Seven tibble datasets replace the previous IPW-only reference designs:

- `gss_2024`: GSS 2024 (3,309 rows, 32 columns) with derived `age_f3`,
  `race_f4`, `pid_f3`, `edu_f3`, and `wt_pop` columns.
- `ns_wave1`: National Survey Wave 1 (6,422 rows, 185 columns) with
  derived `age_f3`, `race_f4`, `pid_f3`, and `edu_f3` columns; `gender`
  converted to factor.
- `npors_2025`: Pew NPORS 2025 (5,022 rows, 71 columns) with derived
  `gender` (factor), `age_f3`, `race_f4`, `pid_f3`, `edu_f3`, and
  `wt_pop` columns.
- `npors_2025_clean`: `npors_2025` filtered to complete cases on the
  derived columns (4,814 rows).
- `cps_2023`: CPS ASEC 2023 (9,999 rows, 187 columns) with derived
  `age_f3`, `race_f4`, and `edu_f3` columns.
- `pew_2016_optin`: Pew 2016 opt-in sample (2,000 rows, 305 columns).
- `pew_2016_synth_pop`: Pew 2016 synthetic population (20,000 rows, 43
  columns).

No survey design companion objects are shipped. Examples construct
designs from the tibbles with
[`surveycore::as_survey()`](https://jdenn0514.github.io/surveycore/reference/as_survey.html)
or
[`surveycore::as_survey_nonprob()`](https://jdenn0514.github.io/surveycore/reference/as_survey_nonprob.html).

#### Retired datasets

The following datasets have been removed. Update code that references
them:

| Old name | Replacement |
|----|----|
| `ns_wave1_ipw` | `ns_wave1` |
| `gss_ipw_ref` | `gss_2024` + `surveycore::as_survey(gss_2024, weights = wt_pop, ...)` |
| `npors_2025_ref` | `npors_2025` |
| `npors_2025_clean_ref` | `npors_2025_clean` |
| `acs_ipw_ref` | removed without replacement (the ACS reference is retired) |

#### `ipw()` examples updated

The bundled examples in
[`?ipw`](https://jdenn0514.github.io/surveywts/reference/ipw.md) now use
the new dataset names. Reference designs for IPW are constructed from
tibbles using
[`surveycore::as_survey()`](https://jdenn0514.github.io/surveycore/reference/as_survey.html):

``` r

gss_ref <- surveycore::as_survey(
  gss_2024, weights = wt_pop, strata = vstrat, ids = vpsu, nest = TRUE
)
result <- ipw(ns_wave1, gss_ref, selection = ~sex + age_f3)
```

### Internal

- No test held
  [`create_sdr_weights()`](https://jdenn0514.github.io/surveywts/reference/create_sdr_weights.md)
  to the SDR variance scale factor
  ([\#126](https://github.com/JDenn0514/surveywts/issues/126)). The help
  page states `4 / R`, and PR
  [\#124](https://github.com/JDenn0514/surveywts/issues/124) corrected
  it there, but nothing tied that number to the object the function
  returns. A new block in `tests/testthat/test-replicate-weights.R`
  asserts the scale two ways: a fixed pin, `4 / 32` on a 20-PSU design
  at `replicates = 20L`, and the relation
  `scale == 4 / length(repweights)` over both settings of
  `use_normal_hadamard` and three more replicate counts. `R` is the full
  column count, inactive replicates included. No code changed.

- `test_invariants()` in `tests/testthat/helper-test-data.R` never
  checked a `survey_nonprob` object
  ([\#117](https://github.com/JDenn0514/surveywts/issues/117)). The
  branch for that class tested a bare class name behind a guard:
  `exists("survey_nonprob") && S7::S7_inherits(obj, survey_nonprob)`.
  surveywts does not re-export the class, and `tests/testthat.R`
  attaches only `testthat` and `surveywts`, so the bare name resolved
  nowhere and the guard was always `FALSE`. The parent of
  `survey_nonprob` is the abstract `survey_base`, not `survey_taylor` or
  `survey_replicate`, so no other branch caught the object either. 77 of
  the 282 calls registered zero expectations, most of them in the
  non-probability code:
  [`ipw()`](https://jdenn0514.github.io/surveywts/reference/ipw.md), the
  DAGJK, the quasi-randomization bootstrap, and propensity nonresponse.

  The branch now tests
  [`surveycore::survey_nonprob`](https://jdenn0514.github.io/surveycore/reference/survey_nonprob.html),
  the form the other two branches already use. Each of the 77 calls now
  asserts the four weight invariants: the weight column name is a
  character scalar, the name is present in `@data`, the column is
  numeric, and all values are `>= 0` with at least one `> 0`. The suite
  goes from 3837 to 4145 passing expectations and still reports zero
  failures, so no `survey_nonprob` object in the tests was breaking a
  weight invariant.

  `.claude/standards/testing-surveywts.md` recorded the guard as
  deliberate. It now states that all three branches test the qualified
  class name.

- The `surveywts_warning_class_near_empty` warning was built in three
  places, each with its own `cli_warn()` call: the `"propensity-cell"`
  method of
  [`adjust_nonresponse()`](https://jdenn0514.github.io/surveywts/reference/adjust_nonresponse.md),
  the `"weighting-class"` method of
  [`adjust_nonresponse()`](https://jdenn0514.github.io/surveywts/reference/adjust_nonresponse.md),
  and
  [`redistribute_weights()`](https://jdenn0514.github.io/surveywts/reference/redistribute_weights.md)
  ([\#113](https://github.com/JDenn0514/surveywts/issues/113)). One
  internal helper, `.warn_near_empty_cell()`, now builds all three. Each
  call site passes the nouns for the grouping unit and its members, and
  the first suggested remedy. The message shape, the adjustment-factor
  format, and the class stay in the helper.

  The
  [`redistribute_weights()`](https://jdenn0514.github.io/surveywts/reference/redistribute_weights.md)
  message takes the same shape as the other two. It read
  `Redistribution group "(global)" has 3 recipient(s), adjustment factor 8.33×.`
  and now reads
  `Redistribution group "(global)" is sparse (3 recipient(s), adjustment factor 8.33×).`
  The other two messages are unchanged.

- Add tests for
  [`calibrate_to_survey()`](https://jdenn0514.github.io/surveywts/reference/calibrate_to_survey.md)
  and
  [`calibrate_to_estimate()`](https://jdenn0514.github.io/surveywts/reference/calibrate_to_estimate.md)
  edge cases: `method = "logit"` and non-matrix `vcov_estimate`.

- Remove stale `weighted_df` references left after PR
  [\#86](https://github.com/JDenn0514/surveywts/issues/86) — source
  comments, roxygen `@param` docs, and test descriptions updated
  throughout.

- Dependency changes. `svrep (>= 0.9.1)` and `nleqslv (>= 3.3.2)` move
  to Imports. `anesrake` moves to Suggests, because the raking engine is
  now ported into the package and `anesrake` is used only for parity
  tests. The minimum `surveycore` version is 1.0.0.

## surveywts 0.2.0

### Replicate weight generation

This release adds a full suite of replicate weight functions for
variance estimation.

#### New functions

- [`create_bootstrap_weights()`](https://jdenn0514.github.io/surveywts/reference/create_bootstrap_weights.md):
  Generates bootstrap replicate weights from a `survey_taylor` or
  `survey_nonprob` design, wrapping
  [`svrep::as_bootstrap_design()`](https://bschneidr.github.io/svrep/reference/as_bootstrap_design.html).

- [`create_jackknife_weights()`](https://jdenn0514.github.io/surveywts/reference/create_jackknife_weights.md):
  Generates jackknife replicate weights with two strategies:
  `type = "delete-1"` (JK1 for unstratified, JKn for stratified designs;
  supports `survey_nonprob`) and `type = "random-groups"` (random-group
  jackknife via `svrep`).

- [`create_brr_weights()`](https://jdenn0514.github.io/surveywts/reference/create_brr_weights.md):
  Generates balanced repeated replication (BRR) weights from paired-PSU
  designs. A `rho` argument enables Fay’s BRR variant.

- [`create_gen_boot_weights()`](https://jdenn0514.github.io/surveywts/reference/create_gen_boot_weights.md):
  Generates generalized bootstrap replicate weights via
  [`svrep::as_gen_boot_design()`](https://bschneidr.github.io/svrep/reference/as_gen_boot_design.html),
  supporting 12 variance estimators including Horvitz-Thompson,
  Yates-Grundy, and Deville-Tille.

- [`create_gen_rep_weights()`](https://jdenn0514.github.io/surveywts/reference/create_gen_rep_weights.md):
  Generates Fay’s generalized replication weights via
  [`svrep::as_fays_gen_rep_design()`](https://bschneidr.github.io/svrep/reference/as_fays_gen_rep_design.html),
  with the same set of variance estimators and a `seed` argument for
  reproducibility.

- [`create_sdr_weights()`](https://jdenn0514.github.io/surveywts/reference/create_sdr_weights.md):
  Generates successive difference replication (SDR) weights via
  [`svrep::as_sdr_design()`](https://bschneidr.github.io/svrep/reference/as_sdr_design.html),
  with an optional `sort_var` argument for systematic selection order.

- [`create_replicate_weights()`](https://jdenn0514.github.io/surveywts/reference/create_replicate_weights.md):
  Unified dispatcher that routes to the appropriate `create_*_weights()`
  function based on a `method` argument.

- [`as_taylor_design()`](https://jdenn0514.github.io/surveywts/reference/as_taylor_design.md):
  Reconstructs a `survey_taylor` design from a `survey_replicate`,
  reading the original design structure from the weighting history.

#### New methods

- [`print()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/print.html) for `survey_replicate`
  objects displays the design type, replicate count, scale, weight
  summary, and full weighting history.

## surveywts 0.1.2

### Breaking changes

- The default output weight column name for
  [`calibrate()`](https://jdenn0514.github.io/surveywts/reference/calibrate.md),
  `rake()`,
  [`poststratify()`](https://jdenn0514.github.io/surveywts/reference/poststratify.md),
  and
  [`adjust_nonresponse()`](https://jdenn0514.github.io/surveywts/reference/adjust_nonresponse.md)
  changes from `".weight"` to `"wts"` when the input is a plain
  `data.frame` with `weights = NULL`.

### New features

- [`calibrate()`](https://jdenn0514.github.io/surveywts/reference/calibrate.md),
  `rake()`,
  [`poststratify()`](https://jdenn0514.github.io/surveywts/reference/poststratify.md),
  and
  [`adjust_nonresponse()`](https://jdenn0514.github.io/surveywts/reference/adjust_nonresponse.md)
  gain a `wt_name` argument (default `"wts"`) that controls the name of
  the output weight column for `data.frame` and `weighted_df` inputs.
  Input weight columns are preserved when `wt_name` differs from the
  input column name. `wt_name` is silently ignored for survey object
  inputs.

## surveywts 0.1.1

### Breaking changes

- [`adjust_nonresponse()`](https://jdenn0514.github.io/surveywts/reference/adjust_nonresponse.md)
  now returns all rows with nonrespondent weights set to 0, instead of
  dropping nonrespondent rows. This preserves design structure for
  variance estimation. Code that uses `nrow(result)` to count
  respondents should use `sum(result$weight_col > 0)` instead.

- [`poststratify()`](https://jdenn0514.github.io/surveywts/reference/poststratify.md)
  now defaults to `type = "prop"`, consistent with
  [`calibrate()`](https://jdenn0514.github.io/surveywts/reference/calibrate.md)
  and `rake()`. Existing code that relies on the count default should
  add explicit `type = "count"`.

### Bug fixes

- [`calibrate()`](https://jdenn0514.github.io/surveywts/reference/calibrate.md),
  `rake()`, and
  [`poststratify()`](https://jdenn0514.github.io/surveywts/reference/poststratify.md)
  now delegate to
  [`survey::calibrate()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/survey/man/calibrate.html),
  [`survey::rake()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/survey/man/rake.html),
  [`anesrake::anesrake()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/anesrake/man/anesrake.html),
  and
  [`survey::postStratify()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/survey/man/postStratify.html)
  instead of vendored algorithm copies. This improves numerical
  correctness and maintainability
  ([\#16](https://github.com/JDenn0514/surveywts/issues/16)).

- [`adjust_nonresponse()`](https://jdenn0514.github.io/surveywts/reference/adjust_nonresponse.md)
  `response_status` argument now resolves via
  [`tidyselect::eval_select()`](https://tidyselect.r-lib.org/reference/eval_select.html)
  instead of
  [`rlang::as_name()`](https://rlang.r-lib.org/reference/as_name.html),
  supporting tidy-select semantics and providing a clearer error for
  multi-column selection
  ([\#15](https://github.com/JDenn0514/surveywts/issues/15)).

- Input validation in
  [`calibrate()`](https://jdenn0514.github.io/surveywts/reference/calibrate.md),
  `rake()`,
  [`poststratify()`](https://jdenn0514.github.io/surveywts/reference/poststratify.md),
  and
  [`adjust_nonresponse()`](https://jdenn0514.github.io/surveywts/reference/adjust_nonresponse.md)
  now uses `survey_base` inheritance checks instead of listing specific
  class names
  ([\#15](https://github.com/JDenn0514/surveywts/issues/15)).

- [`summarize_weights()`](https://jdenn0514.github.io/surveywts/reference/summarize_weights.md)
  grouped path now uses `paste(sep = "//")` instead of
  [`interaction()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/interaction.html), avoiding
  separator collisions with factor levels containing dots (e.g.,
  `"Dr."`) ([\#13](https://github.com/JDenn0514/surveywts/issues/13)).

- `survey_nonprob` print method now shows
  `"Variance: model-assisted (SRS assumption)"` instead of incorrectly
  labelling it as Taylor linearization
  ([\#13](https://github.com/JDenn0514/surveywts/issues/13)).

### Internal

- Moved shared helpers `.check_input_class()` and `.get_history()` to
  `R/utils.R`; inlined `%||%` operator
  ([\#12](https://github.com/JDenn0514/surveywts/issues/12)).

- Moved `survey` from Suggests to Imports; added `anesrake` to Imports
  ([\#16](https://github.com/JDenn0514/surveywts/issues/16)).

## surveywts 0.1.0

### Breaking changes

- [`adjust_nonresponse()`](https://jdenn0514.github.io/surveywts/reference/adjust_nonresponse.md)
  now returns all rows with nonrespondent weights set to 0, instead of
  dropping nonrespondent rows. This preserves design structure for
  variance estimation. Code that uses `nrow(result)` to count
  respondents should use `sum(result$weight_col > 0)` instead.

- [`poststratify()`](https://jdenn0514.github.io/surveywts/reference/poststratify.md)
  now defaults to `type = "prop"`, consistent with
  [`calibrate()`](https://jdenn0514.github.io/surveywts/reference/calibrate.md)
  and `rake()`. Existing code that relies on the count default should
  add explicit `type = "count"`.

### Calibration: Weighting Core

This is the first release of surveywts, implementing the core survey
weighting workflow.

#### New classes

- `weighted_df`: An S3 subclass of tibble that carries a `weight_col`
  attribute identifying the weight column and a `weighting_history`
  attribute recording every weighting operation applied. Produced as
  output from calibration and nonresponse functions when the input is a
  plain `data.frame` or `weighted_df`. Supports dplyr verbs (`select()`,
  `rename()`, `mutate()`) with automatic downgrade to a plain tibble
  (with a warning) if the weight column is removed.

- `survey_nonprob` (from surveycore): surveywts implements
  [`print()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/print.html) for `survey_nonprob`
  objects, displaying design variables and weighting history.

#### New functions

- [`calibrate()`](https://jdenn0514.github.io/surveywts/reference/calibrate.md):
  Calibrate survey weights to known marginal population totals using
  linear (GREG) or logit (bounded IRLS) calibration for categorical
  auxiliary variables.

- `rake()`: Iterative proportional fitting to marginal population
  targets. Supports two methods: `"anesrake"` (chi-square variable
  selection with improvement-based convergence) and `"survey"`
  (fixed-order IPF with epsilon-based convergence). Margins may be a
  named list or a long data frame with `variable`, `level`, and `target`
  columns.

- [`poststratify()`](https://jdenn0514.github.io/surveywts/reference/poststratify.md):
  Exact post-stratification to known joint population cell counts or
  proportions in a single non-iterative pass.

- [`adjust_nonresponse()`](https://jdenn0514.github.io/surveywts/reference/adjust_nonresponse.md):
  Weighting-class nonresponse adjustment that redistributes
  nonrespondent weights to respondents within cells defined by `by`.
  Methods `"propensity"` and `"propensity-cell"` are stubbed for the
  Propensity release.

- [`effective_sample_size()`](https://jdenn0514.github.io/surveywts/reference/effective_sample_size.md):
  Kish’s effective sample size (`ESS = (Σw)² / Σw²`).

- [`weight_variability()`](https://jdenn0514.github.io/surveywts/reference/weight_variability.md):
  Coefficient of variation of survey weights.

- [`summarize_weights()`](https://jdenn0514.github.io/surveywts/reference/summarize_weights.md):
  Full distributional summary (n, mean, CV, ESS, percentiles),
  optionally grouped by one or more variables.

All functions accept `data.frame`, `weighted_df`, `survey_taylor`, and
`survey_nonprob` inputs, and append a structured weighting history entry
on every call.

#### Bug fixes

- [`calibrate()`](https://jdenn0514.github.io/surveywts/reference/calibrate.md),
  `rake()`, and
  [`poststratify()`](https://jdenn0514.github.io/surveywts/reference/poststratify.md)
  now preserve the input class (`survey_taylor` or `survey_nonprob`)
  rather than promoting all survey object inputs to `survey_nonprob`
  ([\#10](https://github.com/JDenn0514/surveywts/issues/10)).
